Create a Development SSL Certificate and Key

1. Open command-line in Administrator mode
2. Move to the directory you want to put the keys at
3. In the command-line

1. Create Certificate Authority Key
   Terminal: openssl genrsa -des3 -out {CA}.key 4096
   Terminal: Passphrase for {CA}.key
   Terminal: openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key {CA}.key -sha256 
   -days 1095 -out {CA}.pem
   Terminal: Enter previously given passphrase for {CA}.key
   Terminal: Enter In Fake Information for CA Authority

2. (optional) Installing Certificate Authority 

3. Create Development Server Certificate Signing Request
   Terminal: openssl genrsa -out {localhost}.key 4096
   Terminal: openssl req -new -key {localhost}.key -out {localhost}.csr
   Terminal: Enter In Fake Information for Server
   Terminal: (optional) Enter challenge passphrase

4. Create Ext File
### Copy the latter into a text file ###

authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = localhost

### Copy the prior ###
   Change file extensions to {something}.ext

5. Create Development Server Certificate
    # The argument x509 req is different from the creation -x509 req
    Terminal: openssl x509 -req -in {localhost}.csr -CA {CA}.pem -CAkey {CA}.key 
    -CAcreateserial -out {localhost}.crt -days 730 -sha256 -extfile {something}.ext 
    # A {CA}.srl and a {localhost}.crt file will be created
