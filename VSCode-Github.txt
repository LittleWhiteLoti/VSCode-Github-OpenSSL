Ignore directory changes in VSCode
   * Useful if a directory is changed a lot, such as, node_modules
   1. In the root of your project, same as the .git directory, create a text file called .gitignore
   2. The file itself should contain directories or files you wish to ignore in any sub-directories. If you need to fine-tune the 
      ignore, follow the PATTERN FORMAT at https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
      Example: node_modules/ 
   * The files and directories will still be tracked in the Explorer window if they were created before the .gitignore file was 
     created.
   4. Go to the file in VSCode Explorer and you should see the .gitignore.txt. Remove the .txt extension. .gitignore is a special
      extension that github uses.
   5. Close VSCode and launch it again to make sure the .gitignore configurations are loaded 
   6. Find a directory with a lot of packages and run npm install to test that the .gitignore file works
