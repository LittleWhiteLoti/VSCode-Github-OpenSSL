Syncing Visual Studio Code with Github.com account
   1. Download GitHub extension
   2. Download GitHub Pull Requests extension
   3. Open terminal (Shortcut Ctrl + `)
      Terminal: git config --global user.name {{ USERNAME }}
      Terminal: git config --global user.email {{ EMAIL }}
   4. Click Github Pull Request extension on the side window
   5. Click Sign In and a window will pop up asking you to sign into Github 
   and to add an OAuth token.
   * You may have to do a pull or push to a repository for the user dialog 
   window shows up asking you to sign into github.com

Disable Diagnostics Crash Reporting
   1. File > Preferences > Settings
   2. Search Telemetry
   3. Uncheck both boxes
   4. Restart VSCode

Enable Bash Terminal
   1. Open search bar with Ctrl + Shift + p
   2. In the search bar type > Shell
   3. Select "Terminal Select Default Shell"
   4. Select "Git Bash"

Start a terminal at a specific directory

   2. Type into the .bashrc file
      # cd ~/path/to/directory
   3. Save .bashrc file
   4. Restart the terminal

Ignore directory changes in VSCode
   * Useful if a directory is changed a lot, such as, node_modules
   1. In the root of your project, same as the .git directory, create a text file called .gitignore
   2. The file itself should contain directories or files you wish to ignore in any sub-directories. If you need to fine-tune the 
      ignore, follow the PATTERN FORMAT at https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
      Example: node_modules/ 
   * The files and directories will still be tracked in the Explorer window if they were created before the .gitignore file was 
     created.
   4. Go to the file in VSCode Explorer and you should see the .gitignore.txt. Remove the .txt extension. .gitignore is a special
      extension that github uses.
   5. Close VSCode and launch it again to make sure the .gitignore configurations are loaded 
   6. Find a directory with a lot of packages and run npm install to test that the .gitignore file works
   
Download Nodejs
   1. Download Node Version Manager from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
   2. Restart the terminal in Visual Studio Code
   3. Turn nvm on
       # nvm on
   4. View all the version of nvm
       # nvm list available
   5. Install the latest LTS version
       # nvm install x.x.x
   6. Use the installation of node
       # nvm use x.x.x
   7. Confirm the installation of node version
       # nvm list

Install and starting vuejs 3
   1. npm i -g @vue/cli
   2. npm i vue@3.1.2 --save
   3. vue create {{ project name }}
   *  You cannot use the latest suffix because that points to vuejs 2.6.14
   4. vue upgrade
   5. npm list vue
   *  It should list vuejs as version 3
   *  Upgrade core-js to ^3.6.5
   *  Add preinstall and resolutions to package.json to fix vulnerablities known for the following packages css-what, glob-parent, postcss, postcss-focus

Fixing security Vulerabilities
   1. Install ncu-check-updates
   2. Terminal: ncu
   3. Update all out-of-date packages
      Terminal: npm -install
   4. Install npx globally
      Terminal: npm i -g npx
   5. In the package.json under the scripts add the following line
      # "preinstall": "npx npm-force-resolutions"
   6. Further down the package.json, preferably after "devdevDependencies" add a "resolutions" area
   7. Look for packages with a vulnerable source package
   8. Download the newest version of the package with the --save-dev flag
   9. Add that package and version to the resolutions area of the package.json
  10. Completely delete the node_modules folder
  11. Run npm install and you should see the preinstall script run
  12. There should be no Vulerabilities now. However, if you run npm list you will probably get a bunch of red extraneous errors. 
      Don't pay too much attention to it

Loading npm packages from github (public)
   1. In the "dependencies" specify the repository/package name as the key preceded with @ sign and the location 
      "github:{{ repository name }}/{{ package name }}" as the value
      Example: dependencies: {
         "@new-packages/my-new-package": "github:new-packages/my-new-package"
      }

Initial commit from local repository to remote (without a pre-existing remote repository)
Note: This uses github's create repository API and allows a repository to be 
      initialized from the commend-line. You will need a http command-line tool like cURL
      or wget
Note: If your Windows 10 build is 17063 then curl is installed by default
   * Use of the API without username and password are slowly being deprecated and will be entirely
      unusable by Sept 2020, please use the next instruction set
   1. Open terminal (Shortcut Ctrl + `)
   *  This uses the cURL http command-line tool
      Terminal: curl -u '{{ USERNAME }}:{{ PASSWORD }}' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"{{ repository Name }}","description":"{{ repository description }}"}'
   *  To add additional parameters to your repo initialization add them to the JSON at the end. The only key-value that is required is:
      "name":"Repository Name". Avoid spaces in the repository.
   *  Read the ref at the end to learn about how to use the API tool. Warning: The 
      instruction on how to use the API can change at any time without warning so be
      aware that something that works one day might no longer work another day
   2. Create folder on your system to act as the new local repository on your system
   3. Move into the directory where your local repository will live
      Termianl: cd /Path/To/Repository
   4. Link the local repository to the remote, do an initial commit
      Terminal: git init
      Terminal: git add .
      Terminal: git commit -m "Initial commit"
      Terminal: git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/PATH_TO_NEW_REPOSITORY.git
      Terminal: git push -u origin master

Initial commit from local repository to remote (without a pre-existing remote repository) using Authorization Code
Note: This uses github's create repository API and allows a repository to be 
      initialized from the commend-line. You will need a http command-line tool like cURL
      or wget
Note: If your Windows 10 build is 17063 then curl is installed by default
   1. Log on to your account in github.com
   2. Go to Developer Settings in your account
   3. Click Personal Access Tokens
   4. Click Generate New Token
   5. In the note put something like token for Github API access
   6. Give it the (parent) `repo` and `delete_repo` permission
   *  (Optional) Give the token all permissions
   7. Click Generate Token
   8. You will be redirected to your personal access tokens page with your new token on top
   9. Go to VSCode
  10. Open terminal (Shortcut Ctrl + `)
   *  This uses the cURL http command-line tool
      Terminal: curl -u '{{ USERNAME }}:{{ Token }}' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"{{ repository Name }}","description":"{{ repository description }}"}'
   *  To add additional parameters to your repo initialization add them to the JSON at the end. The only key-value that is required is:
      "name":"Repository Name". Avoid spaces in the repository.
   *  Read the ref at the end to learn about how to use the API tool. Warning: The 
      instruction on how to use the API can change at any time without warning so be
      aware that something that works one day might no longer work another day

Initial push from local repository to remote on github (with existing remote repository)
   1. Create repository on github
   2. Create folder on your system to act as the new local repository on your system
   3. Move into the directory where your local repository will live
      Terminal: cd /Path/To/Repository
   4. Link the local repository to the remote, do an initial commit
      Terminal: git init
      Terminal: git add .
   *  When doing a commit it is super important that a file exists within what is being being committed because git will ignore directories/sub-directories if the do not 
      contain any content. This would be a good time to add a .gitignore because all rules are passed down from the top directory to all sub-directories unless a sub-directory
      has its own .gitignore.	  
      Terminal: git commit -m "Initial commit"
      Terminal: git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/PATH_TO_NEW_REPOSITORY.git
      Terminal: git branch -M main
      Note: Use the command below for additional pushes
      Terminal: git push -u origin main
	  
Pushes from local repository to remote
Note: Complete the instruction for one of the "Initial commit from local repository to remote"
      above before doing this
   1. Navigate to repository with a .git already in it. If it does not exists use the previous instructions
   2. Open terminal (Shortcut Ctrl + `)
      Terminal: git add .
      Terminal: git commit -m "Initial commit"
      Terminal: git branch -M main
      Terminal: git push -u origin main

Creating new local repository from existing remote repository
   1. Make sure you are in the directory you want the local copy of your repository to live in
   2. Open terminal (Shortcut Ctrl + `)
      Terminal: git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/PATH_TO_EXISTING_REPOSITORY.git
   3. Open the local repository folder from VSCode in File > Open Folder... > "repository folder name"
   *  The clone command will automatically track the repository changes
