Visual Studio Code Problems & Solutions

Files Not Tracking

   Put the file/folder is the correct directory? 
   It should be in the same directory as the .git
   folder as the README.md and all the other files. 


   Another solution is if Visual Studio Code cannot locate the git.path in its Settings.json
   1. File > Preferences > Settings
   2. Search git path
   3. Look for Git: Path and click Edit in settings.json
   4. Look for the git.path key and the value should be an empty string.
   5. Set the key-value pair as "git.path": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exe"
   6. Save the file and reset Visual Studio Code
   7. Then try step first step again
